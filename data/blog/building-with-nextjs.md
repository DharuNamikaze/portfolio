# Building Modern Web Apps with Next.js

Next.js has revolutionized how we build React applications, providing an excellent developer experience with built-in optimizations.

## Key Features I Love

### 1. App Router
The new App Router in Next.js 13+ provides:
- Nested layouts
- Server components by default
- Improved data fetching
- Better performance

### 2. Built-in Optimizations
- Image optimization with next/image
- Font optimization with next/font
- Automatic code splitting
- Static generation and ISR

## My Setup

Here's my typical Next.js configuration:

```typescript
// next.config.ts
import type { NextConfig } from 'next'

const nextConfig: NextConfig = {
  experimental: {
    turbo: {},
  },
}

export default nextConfig
```

## Performance Tips

1. Use server components when possible
2. Implement proper loading states
3. Optimize images with next/image
4. Use the built-in font optimization
5. Leverage static generation for content-heavy pages

## Conclusion

Next.js continues to be my go-to framework for building performant, scalable web applications. The developer experience is unmatched, and the performance benefits are automatic.
